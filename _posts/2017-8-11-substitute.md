My initial guess was that this was some sort of ROT13 encryption. However, I quickly realized that it was something different that ROT13. I tried rotations of the alphabet all the way up to a rotation of 20 with no luck. I searched for an online cipher-text analyzer and stumbled accross a website called quipquip.com.
