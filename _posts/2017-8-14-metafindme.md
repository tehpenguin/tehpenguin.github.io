Meta Find Me

<i>Find the location of the flag in the image: image.jpg. Note: Latitude and longitude values are in degrees with no degree symbols,/direction letters, minutes, seconds, or periods. They should only be digits. The flag is not just a set of coordinates - if you think that, keep looking!
HINTS
How can images store location data? Perhaps search for GPS info on photos</i>
