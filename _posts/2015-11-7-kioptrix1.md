Welcome to my blog! We will be taking a look at Kioptrix 1.1 today. Lets fire up the virtual machine and get started.

First we need to find the ip address of our new target. I used netdiscover here and found the targets ip to be 192.168.153.135

Lets continue. So we know our IP address is 192.168.153.135, so lets find out some more information about our target with nmap

We quickly get some results with several different ports to explore.

Samba stands out for its known security flaws. My next goal was to discover what version of samba was running to see if it is even vulnerable.

Samba version 2.2.1 is vulnerable to the trans2open exploit. The exploit is available in msfconsole.

I set RHOST to the ip of my target, then ran the exploit. Root obtained! Id and Uname -a confirms we are root in kioptrix. Better luck next time Kioptrix!
