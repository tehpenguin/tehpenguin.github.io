The attacker starts out with netdiscover to find the ip address of his target machine. Netdsicover finds the ip address of 172.16.158.133 for the new target.

The attacker then uses nmap to discover any open ports and see if any services are running on those ports.

The nmap scan reveals that port 80 is open and is running apache. The attacker then opens up his webbrowser and enters the target machines ip address into the browser. The website has a login page and no other content.

The attacker tries a simple sql injection attack on the login page, but it is unsuccessful. The attackers next step is to use tamper data to see where the login information is being posted to.

The attacker then uses the gathered post information and starts sqlmap. The attacker plugs in the gathered POST information into his sqlmap scan and uses the dump command to gather more information.

The sqlmap scan reveals two user names as well as passwords. The attacker then attempts to log in to the website with the gathered credentials. However, there is not much information once the attacker logs in.

The attacker then decides to ssh into the target machine using the credentials from the sqlmap dump. He is able to successfully ssh in but the shell appears to be limited.
