We need to gain access to some routers. Let's try and see if we can find the password in the captured network data: data.pcap.
HINTS
It looks like someone logged in with their password earlier. Where would log in data be located in a network capture?
If you think you found the flag, but it doesn't work, consider that the data may be encrypted.
