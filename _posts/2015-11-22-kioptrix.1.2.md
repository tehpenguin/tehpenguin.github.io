The ip of kioptrix 1.3 is listed as 172.16.158.130 as seen above. Next he uses nmap to see which ports are open and possible see which services are running on those ports.

He sees that port 80 is open, which means the target machine is most likely hosting a website. The attacker enters the ip of the target machine into his web browser for further evaluation.

SQL injection does not appear to work in this case. The attacker returns to the home page and clicks on the link at the bottom of the page describing a new gallery.
